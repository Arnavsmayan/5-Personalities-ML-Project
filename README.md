# Personality Classification Project

![Personality Types](personality_types.jpg)

This project classifies people into five personality types using the Big Five personality traits. The Big Five personality traits are a widely-used model of personality that describes five broad dimensions of personality:

1. Introversion vs. Extroversion
2. Agreeableness vs. Antagonism
3. Conscientiousness vs. Impulsiveness
4. Neuroticism vs. Emotional Stability
5. Openness to Experience vs. Closed-Mindedness

The project uses the data from the OpenPsychometrics website, a repository of psychological tests that can be taken online. The data for this project was collected from the NEO-PI-3 test, a widely-used personality test that measures the Big Five personality traits.

The project is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library, a popular machine learning library for Python. The code for the project is well-documented and easy to understand.
